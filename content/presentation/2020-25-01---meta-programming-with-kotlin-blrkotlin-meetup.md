Kotlin has become go-to language for Android developers all over the world and the language itself has a large number of feature sets.
With greater acceptance of language, we look at how we can leverage power of Kotlin for meta-programming.
Through the talk, we'll introduce what Meta-Programming is and how we do it on day to day basis. We'll see how using Kotlin's internal compiler API, we can parse kotlin files, pull data out of it and go through various applications of this data such as custom documentation for API code and much more.
We'll also look at various approaches of source code generation for Kotlin files and how we can leverage them in projects.
