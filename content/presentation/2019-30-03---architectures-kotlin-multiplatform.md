In the current wave of cross platform solutions, Kotlin’s multiplatform is shaping up to be a unique proponent of code reuse. Unlike write once run everywhere, Multiplatform offers a unique space of reusability and formalization of code across platforms and also removes dependency on custom VMs or runtime. Modern apps are build on top of abstractions and architectures which make sure code-bases remain mature, testable and error free. They on the other hand also introduce a lot of boilerplate code. This presents an opportunity of code reuse with help of Kotlin multiplatform. Through this talk, we’ll see how can harness power of Kotlin Multiplatform to create apps using architectures such as MVP, MVI etc and use Kotlin native to build an abstraction layer across platforms. We’ll also go through usage of various multiplatform libraries for database and network management.
