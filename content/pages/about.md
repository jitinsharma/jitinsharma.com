Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner in the internet

#### Work
I currently work as an Android Engineer at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/) in a design focussed team to 
keep UI ASAP(As Shiny As Possible). Previously I worked at [Amadeus Labs](http://www.amadeus.in/), 
building mobile applications for airlines all over the world.

#### Community
I'm a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-jitin_sharma) 
for Android. I occasionally write blogs and do some open source stuff on Github. I also talk a bit about Android and Kotlin at 
meetup groups and conferences, details of which are available [here](/pages/presentations).

I'm also organiser of [BlrDroid](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/blrdroid/) meetup group.
