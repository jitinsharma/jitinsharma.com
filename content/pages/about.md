Hello!

I currently work as an Android Engineer at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/) in a design focussed team to keep UI ASAP(As Shiny As Possible). Previously I worked at [Amadeus Labs](http://www.amadeus.in/), building mobile applications for airlines all over the world.

I ocassionally write blogs and do some open source stuff on Github. I also talk a bit about Android and Kotlin at user groups and conferences details of which are available [here](/pages/presentations) and can always be found hanging around at [BlrDroid](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/blrdroid/) and [BlrKotlin](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/BlrKotlin/) meetup groups.
